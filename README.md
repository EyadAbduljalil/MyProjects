# 🚀 Eyad's Dev Zone

Welcome to my organized chaos 👨‍💻  
This is where all the magic (and the mess) will live — from front-end experiments to back-end adventures and everything in between.

---

## 👨‍🔧 What's this repo for?

- A centralized place for all my upcoming projects.
- Experiments, learning curves, random tests — it all goes here.
- Each folder = a future project. Some will shine, some might crash... and that’s part of the journey 🔥

---

## 🎯 My goals here:

- Learn and apply real-world development workflows
- Build actual projects (not just tutorial clones)
- Explore both frontend & backend like a full-stack warrior
- Grow one commit at a time 💪

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Incoming...

```bash
HTML / CSS / JavaScript
React / Node.js / MongoDB
...and whatever cool tech I pick up next 😎
